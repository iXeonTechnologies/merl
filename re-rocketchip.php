                    <h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    Create Micro-Architecture and Software Specification (MASS) Document
    designed through our methodology that would enable developers or
    enthusiasts to modify Rocket-Chipâ€™s modules and create an Intellectual
    Property (IP) using it.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software Methodology</h3>
<ul class="styled-ul">
        <li>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and high-level Functional
        Programming concepts were used to better understand the structure of the
        Rocket-Chip code.
        </li>
        <li>Flowcharts, UML Class Diagrams and Block Diagrams were made to
        understand the in-depth functionality of each module inside the Rocket-Chip.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Complexity of Task</h3>
<ul class="styled-ul">
    <li>Rocket-Chip contains 328 source files of Scala in 23 directories, and 33,427
    total lines of Scala code.</li>
    <li>To the best of our knowledge there is no previous MASS Document of
    Rocket-Chip available for micro-architecture as well as software level
    understanding.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Future Research</h3>
<ul class="styled-ul">
    <li>Integrate peripherals with the Rocket-Chip SoC that are not available in the
        Rocket-Chip repository which includes GPIO, I2C, JTAG etc.</li>
    <li>Creates parameterizable Micro-Architecture.</li>
    <li>Extend to include the any Extensions.</li>
</ul>
